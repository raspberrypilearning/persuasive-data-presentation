## Build and test

Now it's time to make your data visualisation project.

It is now time to put your idea into action. In order to be successful with a programming project, you need to use **decomposition** skills to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts. 

Take each part at a time, get it working and then move on to the next part. This also makes it easier to spot errors in your code because you will be able to remember the last time that it worked. 

### Example decomposition

Does your idea require a drawing to appear on the screen based on data in a text file? If so, you can break this problem down into the following parts:

1. Write the code for drawing a shape or loading an image
2. Make the image appear in the centre of the screen to test it
3. Load the required data from the text file
4. `print()` the data that you need for the image location to check that the code works
5. Use the data to place the image in the correct location

**Tip:** Test after every new piece of code entered. This makes it much easier to debug your code.
