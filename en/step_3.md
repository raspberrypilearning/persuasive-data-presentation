## Build and test

Now it's time to make your data visualisation project.

In order to be successful with a programming project, you need to use **decomposition** skills to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts. This means you should take each part at a time and get it working before moving on to the next part. 

**Tip:** Test your code after each new section to make it easier to find and fix new errors.

Does your idea require a drawing to appear on the screen based on data in a text file? If so, you can break this problem down in the following way:

1. Write the code for drawing a shape or loading an image
2. Make the image appear in the centre of the screen to test it
3. Load the required data from the text file
4. `print()` the data that you need for the image location to check that the code works
5. Use the data to place the image in the correct location

Think about the steps that you will need to take in order to be successful in your project. Will you need to display a chart or an image? What skills will you need to make that happen?
