## Expand and test - User interaction

Now its time to add some user interaction to your data visualisation!

Look at the [ISS expedition project](https://trinket.io/python/822033c5b6){:target="_blank"} project. It asks the user to choose an ISS expedition to explore. The user enters a number and then this number is used to:
+ access the relevant data for that expedition
+ draw flags on the ISS based on the data
+ display the relevant expedition data as output for the user

**Could your project do something similar?**

Look at the [UFO tracker](https://trinket.io/python/cb376de667){:target="_blank"} project. This project allows the user to click on the different shapes that are displayed on the map. When the user clicks on an object, a message is shown to say the **type** of UFO that was spotted in that location. 

**Could you use this idea to help you add user interaction to your project?**

Explore the [World Happiness Index](https://trinket.io/python/0507433548){:target="_blank"} project. This asks the user to choose what type of data is displayed to them in a graph.

**Could you give your user options about the type of data they want to see?**

Think about your own project and the data that you want your users to be able to explore. Draw inspiration from the example projects and think about how your project could interact with the user.
