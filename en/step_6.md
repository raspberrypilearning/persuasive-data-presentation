## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas to add more already or you might want to go back to the first step and look at other projects again for more inspiration.

You could:
- Analyse the data from the CSV file to calculate totals or averages that could be displayed in charts.
- Think of other ways to present your data. Could you have different shapes? Could you use an image?
- Add other images to your background to give it more detail

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project in Trinket and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.

**This needs to be setup**

Take a look at some of the data visualisations created by community members in the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s studio [Persuasive Data Presentation Projects]().
